This is the assignment submission for the job assignment of pothi.com

Getting Started: 

    This file includes  little description about the project what is it and briefly explained the steps how to execute the project on idle or jupyter notebook/         Google Colab

    Note: I will recommend to use the google Colab to run the project

Description:

    The project that you are going to run has a name Wikipedia Report which is designed with the help of various libraries of python to generate the report of users     and domain with their edit count and count of unique titles in a sorted manner respectively. The report is being generated every minute after parsing the last       five minute data which is coming through  live streaming api provided by the Pothi.com an organisation in the assignment.

Prerequisite :

    Please install the following things before executing the code.

        Installing IDLE and Jupyter Notebook:

           Step 2: Click on jupyter notebook and select the upload option and upload the file with extension .ipynb

           Step 3: After Successfully upload the file name will be appeared and click on the file name to open the file

    Using the Google Colab

          Step 1: Click on the following link provided: https://colab.research.google.com/

          Step 2: Click on the upload option and upload the file with the extension .ipynb

    Installing the library 

        Please install the following library in the installed directory
            1. sseclient 
            2. time
            3. copy
            4. json
            5. multiprocessing
 


        For installing the library write as following in terminal after changing the directory where environment installs
            
            pip install sseclient

        Note: If you are using google colab then use the syntax as following at the topmost cell :

            ! pip install sseclient
Execution:

        IDLE:  Follow the following steps to execute the code file in the idle:
	           Step 1. Save the file or press ctrl + s on windows or ^ +s in mac 

             Step 2. Click on Run or Press F5 for Windows or Mac
